Akari Light-Up Puzzle using JavaFX, User Interfaces, Maven, CSS for styling, and Model View Controller Design Principles.

Here, I designed an interactive game that has a variety of Light-Up Puzzles in a library, which can be navigated through with buttons, where each puzzle can be solved and reset.
